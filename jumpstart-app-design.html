    <p class="bold tera pad-t-1 push-1-2"> Overview </p>
    <p class="pad-b-1 pad-t-1">Jumpstart is an app based on health and fitness. It encourages individuals to stay active with different workout plans, or single workouts. To stay motivated it has features that allow the user to share workouts with friends or to social media.</p>

    <p class="bold tera pad-t-1 push-1-2"> Usability Testing </p>
    <p>Usability testing a great way for users to test out your app and recieve feedback. A great way to see if you have solved the problem at hand, or how to improve. Before moving onto the final prototype. In this round of research I decided that the original app design had to many steps for a user who was new to exercise, so I took a step back and remodeled the concept. </p>

    <p class="bold tera pad-t-1 push-1-2"> Final Product </p>
    <p class=""> Overall this app is targeted at users who are new to fitness and health. I decided to go with a less intense design by using light colours and a simple layout. Keeping it user friendly and giving users the sense that working out can be fun.
