    <p class="caps tera pad-t push-1-2"> Overview </p>
    <p> The theme of my Isometric Illustration is the construction of a hamburger. The idea was to take the theme literally and have construction workers collecting everything you would need for a hamburger. Starting from a farm, to the construction process itself, and off to a restaurant.</p>
